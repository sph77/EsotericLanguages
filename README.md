# EsotericLanguages
Practicing with non-practical programming languages

Inspired by https://github.com/MariusGarbea/UniversalFibonacci

The goal is to see how many implementations of the Fibonacci sequence can be done, by using languages listed here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language

This gives opportunity to practice in unknown syntaxes, improve ability to pick up new languages, and add plenty of pointless bulletpoints to your resume.
