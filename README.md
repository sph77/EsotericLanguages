# EsotericLanguages
Practicing with non-practical programming languages

Inspired by https://github.com/MariusGarbea/UniversalFibonacci

The goal is to find all three digit numbers that are equal to the sum of the cubes of the digits, by using languages listed here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language
And here: https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page

Thanks bls96 for the challenge

I'd do hello world or Fibonacci, but most of these languages already have implementations, so theres not much of a point in solving those.

This gives opportunity to practice in unknown syntaxes, improve ability to pick up new languages, and add plenty of pointless bulletpoints to your resume.
